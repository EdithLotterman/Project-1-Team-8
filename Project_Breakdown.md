- Cleaning: Fix runtime, production country and genre col, so that all match with each string format.
- Drop NA's for runtime and age_certification (N/A). 
- For genre, do a loop and count through genre, for the count take the top 5, then add an indicator variable for 
    each of these genres as a column. E.g. if drama ==1 and == 0 otherwise. 
- 4 categories= English Films: 264, English Show: 154, Non-English Films: 116, Non-English Show: 148
Correlations: runtime and imdb rating or votes, age_certification and imdb score or votes, year and score or hours watched, highest rank and cumulative weeks in top ten.
Total hours viewed for each rank for English-films, how much time is the top show watched vs. number two vs. number three, etc.
